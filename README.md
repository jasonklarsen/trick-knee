Trick Knee
==========
*"My trick-knee been actin' up -- must be a storm-a-comin'"*

The goal of this project is a simple bit of code to give you another 'sense' for your projects. You can think of it like a Build Monitor, but for those places where visual indicators don't make sense.

This build a core executable jar that can be integrated into other projects. The jar can also be used within any other JVM-based project.
