==========
*"My trick-knee been actin' up -- must be a storm a-comin'"*

The goal of this project is a simple bit of code to give you another 'sense' for your projects. You can think of it like a Build Monitor, but for those places where visual indicators don't make as much sense like the commandline.

This builds a core executable jar that can be integrated into other projects. The jar can also be used inside any other JVM-friendly project.

Usage
-----

As a pre-built Java jar:

     java -jar trick-knee-0.1.jar

TODO
----

- Proper configuration
- List of configuration options
- Explanations of how to use in a JVM project
- Links to derived projects (sbt plugin?)
